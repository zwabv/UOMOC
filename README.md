# UOMOC
a method for underwater image classification，directly related to the manuscript submitted to The Visual Computer.

This project leverages the CLIP pre-trained model, integrating adapters with learnable prompt learning strategies to accomplish multi-label classification tasks for underwater optical images. It supports both full-data training and few-shot learning modes, completing classification and evaluation for 10 categories of underwater objects. The project outputs multi-dimensional metrics including mAP, F1, and CNKI, while also providing resource assessments such as model parameter counts and computational requirements.
